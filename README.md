# Waste-Classification

The Waste Classification Project is designed to harness the power of machine learning and  
artificial intelligence to tackle the pressing issue of waste segregation and management. 
This project allows users to upload an image of waste, which the model then analyzes to predict 
the type of waste. Along with the waste classification, the system provides relevant information 
and references on how to dispose of, recycle, or repurpose the waste, highlighting the 
importance of proper waste management. <br>
Proper waste management is crucial for maintaining environmental sustainability. By 
effectively classifying and managing waste, we can prevent pollution, conserve natural 
resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect public health. This project aims to 
educate and empower users to make informed decisions about waste disposal, contributing to 
a cleaner and greener planet. <br>
The primary objective of the Waste Classification Project is to accurately identify different 
types of waste using advanced machine learning algorithms. The model will process the 
uploaded image and classify the waste into categories such as organic, recyclable, hazardous, 
and others. <br>
The project will then provide detailed information about the waste type, including its 
environmental impact, proper disposal methods, and creative ways to repurpose it. 
To achieve this, the project will implement several tools and technologies. The core of the 
project is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, which is well-suited for 
image recognition tasks. Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language, will be 
utilized for developing the model and integrating various components. Additionally, libraries 
such as TensorFlow will be employed for building and training the CNN model. Other essential 
tools include OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) from which  cv2 is the specific 
module used in Python to interact with OpenCV. for image processing and Flask for creating a 
user-friendly web interface. <br>
The Waste Classification Project aims to provide an innovative solution for waste management 
by using AI technology to classify waste and offer valuable information on disposal and 
recycling. By raising awareness and promoting proper waste management practices, this 
project contributes to environmental sustainability and encourages responsible behaviour. 

## **Problem Statement** 
Managing waste is a big challenge because we need to sort and recycle many different types of 
waste efficiently. Traditional methods take a lot of effort, are prone to mistakes, and aren't very 
efficient, which leads to environmental pollution and increased costs. Misclassifying waste can 
pollute soil, water, and air, fill up landfill space, waste resources, and harm wildlife. 
 
Machine learning can help by accurately and automatically classifying different types of waste, 
such as plastic, glass, metal, organic, and paper, using image recognition. By training models 
on large sets of waste images, these systems can learn to recognize and sort waste with high 
accuracy, reducing human error and improving efficiency. This ensures recyclables are properly 
identified and processed, reducing landfill waste and enhancing recycling programs. Properly 
classified organic waste can be composted, reducing methane emissions. Overall, machine 
learning can significantly reduce the environmental impacts of waste misclassification, helping 
create a cleaner and more sustainable future.

## **Model Development** 
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are deep learning models designed for processing **grid-structured data like images**, enabling high-precision classification and object detection. They **automatically extract features** through hierarchical layers, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
In the **Waste Classification Project**, CNNs analyze waste images and categorize them into predefined classes (**battery, cardboard, paper, plastic, food, metal**). By recognizing unique **patterns, textures, and shapes**, they enhance **sorting accuracy and efficiency**, surpassing manual methods.
 <br>
CNNs consist of multiple interconnected layers, each performing a specific function: <br>
**- Convolutional Layers:** These layers extract features such as edges, patterns, and 
textures by applying filters to input images. They help the model recognize distinct 
characteristics of different waste types. 
 
**- ReLU Activation Function:** After convolution, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) 
function introduces non-linearity by converting negative values to zero while retaining 
positive values. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and improves 
performance. 
 
**- Pooling Layers (e.g., MaxPooling):** These layers reduce the spatial size of the feature 
maps by selecting the maximum value within a region (e.g., 2x2). MaxPooling 
enhances computational efficiency, preserves critical features, and makes the model 
more robust to distortions. 
 
**- Fully Connected Layers:** Once the features are extracted and reduced, they are 
flattened and passed through dense layers for final classification into categories such as 
battery, paper, or plastic. 
 
Combining ReLU and MaxPooling in CNNs ensures that the model efficiently captures 
relevant features, minimizes unnecessary complexity, and accelerates training. This approach 
enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of tasks like automated waste classification.  

 
# *How CNN Classifies Waste Images*

**1. Extracts Features ( Convolutional Layers )**
  - The CNN begins by analyzing the input image using convolutional layers. These 
  layers apply filters (small grids of weights) that slide over the image, examining small 
  sections at a time. 
  - During this process, the CNN identifies basic patterns such as edges, lines, and textures 
  in the initial layers. As the image progresses through deeper layers, the network learns 
  more complex and specific features, such as curves, shapes, or unique textures specific 
  to each waste type . 
  - The result is a set of feature maps, which highlight the key aspects of the image that 
  help in identifying the waste type. 
 
**2. Identifies Waste Type ( Feature Recognition )**
  - After extracting features, the CNN recognizes specific patterns unique to each type of 
  waste. For example: 
    o The smooth, shiny surface might indicate plastic. 
    o Grainy textures might suggest paper or cardboard. 
    o Reflective surfaces or metallic edges might point to metal. 
  - By analyzing these features, the CNN gains the ability to differentiate between waste 
  categories, making it increasingly adept at classification as training progresses. 
 
**3. Predicts the Category ( Fully Connected Layers )**
  - The extracted features are passed to the fully connected layers, which act like decision
  makers in the CNN. 
  - These layers flatten the feature maps into a single vector and use the learned patterns to 
  compute probability scores for each waste category.  
  - This computation involves assigning weights to the features and combining them to 
  form an overall prediction. 
 
**4. Outputs Classification  ( Choosing the Best Match )** 
  - Finally, the category with the highest probability is selected as the predicted label for 
  the image.  
  - This output is then presented to the user or passed to waste management systems for 
  further processing. 
  This systematic process allows the CNN to automate waste classification with high accuracy 
  and efficiency, reducing errors.
